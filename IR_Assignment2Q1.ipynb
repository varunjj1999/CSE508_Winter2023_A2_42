            " simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small viscosity .   in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow . \n",

            " non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gas .   the theory of an'ideal dissociating'gas developed by lighthill/1957/for conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium is extended to non-equilibrium conditions by postulating a simple rate equation for the dissociation process/including the effects of recombination/ . this equation contains  the'equilibrium'parameters of the lighthill theory plus a further dissociation phenomena . the behaviour of this gas is investigated in flow through a strong normal shock wave and past a bluff body . the assumption is made that the gas receives complete excitation of its rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to the familiar rankine-hugoniot shock wave relations before dissociation begins . the variation of the relevant thermodynamic variables downstream of this region is then computed in a few particular cases . the method used in the latter case is an extension of the'newtonian'theory of hypersonic inviscid flow . in particular, the case of a sphere is treated in some detail . the variation of the shock shape and the sphere diameter to the length scale of the dissociation process, is exhibited for conditions extending from completely undissociated flow to dissociated flow in thermal equilibrium . results would indicate that significant and observable changes from the undissociated values occur, although values for the non-equilibrium parameter are not, at present, available . \n",
